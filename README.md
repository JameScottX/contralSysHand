 An app that communciate with microchips by multiple methods.


##I develop a app that could debug robots by communciation ways.
##It integrated communication methods such as Serial, Bluetooth and Wifi.
##It is not has been done because that i have no time and enegy for that. It has Ui interface.And Wifi  has not been completed yet.
##It has its own protocol. It includes the key part of byte conversion. It is very suitable as an example of communication software.
##It may not work if you only run this project. But it's would be great to refer to it or develop it.
##It was developed in 2018 by Junwen Cui.
