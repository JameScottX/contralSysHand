　　An app based on QT that can communicate with microchips in multiple ways.  


## Here are the details:  
　　I develop a app that could debug robots by communciation ways.  
　　It integrated communication methods such as Serial, Bluetooth and WIFI.  
　　It is not has been done yet because that i have no time and enegy for that. It has UI interface. And WIFI has not been completed yet.  
　　It has its own protocol. It includes the key part of byte conversion. It is very suitable as an example of communication software.  
　　It may not work if you only run this project. But it's would be great to refer to it or develop it.  
　　It was developed in 2018 by Junwen Cui.
